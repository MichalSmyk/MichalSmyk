# üè¶ Education

## Makers Academy Nov'22-March'23

After graduating from the rigorous Makers Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp, my programming
acumen has significantly grown, honing concepts such as ***Test-Driven Development (TDD)***, ***Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP)***, pair programming, and agile methodologies.
 *  ***Project Highlight:*** A project I initiated and completed is 'Solved,' a treasure-hunting game designed for
tourists exploring London. Technologies employed included Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React Native.
The project also allowed me to practice utilising RESTful APIs and Jest for unit testing.
* ***Test-Driven Development:*** I apply TDD practices in my problem-solving approach, habitually writing
automated tests before proceeding with coding. this helps me write clean code that works.
* ***Lifelong Learner:*** I am a resilient and self-motivated person who enjoys continuous learning to improve my
tech skills. During the largely self-driven course, I cultivated a strong foundation in self-discipline and
resourcefulness, vital assets in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
* ***Strategic Coding:*** My proficiency in SOLID and OOP principles informs my coding practice, resulting in
cleaner, easily maintainable software. Strategic thinking facilitates effective planning and prioritization,
ensuring the timely delivery of superior software solutions.
* ***Agile Development:*** A solid grounding in agile development principles underscores my ability to thrive in
fast-paced, collaborative environments. My experience spans numerous engineering projects, focusing on
iterative value delivery to end-users. I also enjoy taking part in agile rituals, like daily stand-ups and retros.
* ***Software Design:*** I have designed and built over 20 web applications, gaining substantial hands-on
experience with Ruby and JavaScript.
* ***Agile Collaboration:*** I have effectively collaborated within agile teams, embodying eXtreme Programming
(XP) values, and mastering the nuances of pair programming, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
(CI/CD), and Git workflows
